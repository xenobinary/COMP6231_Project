\section{Google Cloud Pub/Sub Components} 
Pub/Sub\cite{pubsub_docs} is an asynchronous and scalable messaging service provided by Google Cloud. It is often used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to load and distribute data. 



Pub/Sub acts as a messaging-oriented middleware\cite{pubsub_docs}, rather than synchronous remote procedure calls (RPCs). 

Transiant/persistant, synchronous/asynchronous\cite{ds_book} are two major dimensions that classify communication mechanisms in distributed systems.

that decouples services producing messages from services processing those messages
decouples services by allowing them to communicate without direct connections. 

The producers and consumers in Pub/Sub are called publishers and subscribers\cite{pubsub_docs}. Publishers communicate with subscribers asynchronously by broadcasting events.
